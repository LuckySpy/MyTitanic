## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Setting working directory to be the current file
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))

#Load the files for data analysis
train <- read.csv("train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test  <- read.csv("test.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
gend  <- read.csv("gender_submission.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Create the full initial dataset so that we can do data exploration
test_survive <- merge(test, gend, by = "PassengerId")
train        <- as.data.frame(train[c(1,3:12,2)])
full_titanic <- rbind(test_survive,train)


```


```{r}

```
